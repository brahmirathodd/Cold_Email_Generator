# Cold Email Generator Using LLM, Llama 3.1, LangChain, and Groq

This project automates the process of writing personalized cold emails for software service companies, using advanced AI models, vector databases, and web scraping technologies.

### Overview

The Cold Email Generator is an end-to-end solution designed to help business development teams in software service firms craft targeted emails to potential clients. By leveraging job postings, this tool scrapes relevant details, matches them with the company’s portfolio, and generates customized emails using Llama 3.1 and the Groq platform for fast inference.

### Key Features
- Automated web scraping of job postings to extract essential information like skills and experience requirements.
- Semantic search of company portfolios to find relevant case studies for inclusion in the email.
- Custom cold email generation based on job posting and portfolio data using AI.
- Easy-to-use web interface built with Streamlit for inputting job links and generating emails in seconds.

### Technologies Used
- Llama 3.1: An open-source large language model used for generating natural language emails.
- LangChain: A framework that handles data extraction, web scraping, and integrations with LLMs and databases.
- ChromaDB: A lightweight, open-source vector database for storing and retrieving portfolio data based on skills.
- Groq: A cloud platform for fast LLM inference using Language Processing Units (LPUs).
- Streamlit: A Python-based framework for building the user interface, allowing easy job URL input and email generation.

### Architecture
- Input: The user provides a job posting URL through the Streamlit interface.
- Web Scraping: The tool uses LangChain to scrape job description data (skills, experience, etc.) from the given URL.
- Skill Extraction: Llama 3.1 processes the scraped data, extracting relevant job details and storing them in a structured JSON format.
- Portfolio Matching: ChromaDB searches for portfolio entries that match the extracted skills.
- Email Generation: Llama 3.1 generates a personalized cold email, incorporating job details and portfolio links.
- Output: The final email is displayed in the Streamlit app, ready to be sent to the client.
